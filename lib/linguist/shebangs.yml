# Maps shebang script names to Language names
#
# Language names are implicitly mapped to their downcased versions,
# so this would be redundant:
#
#   Ruby:
#   - ruby

Java:
- groovy

# JavaScript interpreters
JavaScript:
- node

# Ruby interpreters and runners
Ruby:
- macruby
- rake

# Nu shell
Nu:
- nush
